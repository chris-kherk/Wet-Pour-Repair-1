                <h2>How is Wetpour Installed?</h2>
                <p>
                    The installation process of wetpour involves several steps, starting from site preparation and progressing through the mixing and pouring of rubber granules and binder to create a permeable and quick-drying surface suitable for playgrounds and recreational areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Site preparation is the initial stage where the ground is levelled and any debris or existing surface materials are removed to ensure a clean foundation for the wetpour installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the site is ready, a mixture of rubber granules and the binder is carefully prepared, ensuring the correct ratios for optimal performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step involves the precise pouring of the rubber granules and binder mixture onto the prepared surface, allowing for even distribution and smooth finish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The permeability of wetpour allows for efficient drainage, reducing the risk of puddles and creating a safer environment for play.
                </p>
                <h3>Site Preparation</h3>
                <p>
                    The initial phase of wetpour installation involves thorough site preparation to ensure a stable foundation for the surfacing material, particularly important in playgrounds and recreational areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a suitable base for wetpour not only enhances the longevity of the surface but also contributes to the safety and performance of the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before installation, ground works must be carried out, assessing the existing terrain for any inconsistencies or potential hazards that could impact the quality of the finished surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Undertaking these preparations meticulously helps to prevent issues such as uneven settling or poor drainage, ensuring that the wetpour remains durable and resilient under varying weather conditions.
                </p>
                <h3>Mixing and Pouring of Rubber Granules and Binder</h3>
                <p>
                    The mixing and pouring stage involves combining rubber granules with a polyurethane binder to create the rubberised wetpour mixture that will be poured onto the prepared surface for a seamless and impact-absorbing finish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this process, the rubber granules act as the primary material providing the important properties of flexibility and durability, while the polyurethane binder serves as the binding agent that holds the granules together in a cohesive mixture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is crucial to achieve the right ratio of rubber to binder to ensure the wetpour mixture has the correct consistency for proper installation. Consistency is key in creating a surface that is both safe and long-lasting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application techniques involve meticulously pouring and spreading the wetpour mixture evenly over the prepared surface using specialised tools such as trowels and screeds.
                </p>
                <h3>Finishing and Curing Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The final stages of wetpour installation involve finishing touches and the curing process to ensure a smooth and durable rubber surfacing suitable for playgrounds and recreational areas, with minimal maintenance requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finishing touches in Wetpour involve meticulously smoothing out the surface, ensuring uniformity and eliminating any imperfections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This step not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also plays a crucial role in creating a safe and enjoyable playground environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The curing process is equally vital as it allows the rubber to fully set and bond, ensuring long-term durability and resistance to wear and tear.
